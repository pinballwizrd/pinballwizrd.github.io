Multiple generals besiege Byzantium. They've encircled the city, but they must decide when to assault as a group. They will win if all generals assault
simultaneously; however, they will lose if they attack without coordination. In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate
information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information across the network. The allegory was developed to describe a situation in
which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.

The Byzantine general problem can be solved with the help of a blockchain. It's all about giving people a way to communicate safely and securely in an
unpredictable world. In the actual world, most transactions occur between strangers who do not know or trust one another. Each individual is like a
general, waiting for orders to attack or defend their position. There are no middlemen to arbitrate the attack on your behalf; you are entirely on your
own in making your decision. You cannot trust any messanger. A blockchain creates a layer that can be trusted without needing to trust every individual.
This is accomplished by a network of nodes coming together to agree on the truth before it is recorded. If the general is unsure about the substance of
the communication, the other generals can verify it using what they know to be true. Since the system was designed to be utilized by the general public,
fault-tolerant mechanisms and security are in place in a blockchain.

In this scenario, cryptography was required to ensure that the messages could not be altered. The system provides key pairs for digitally signing a
communication to verify identity as proof that it comes from the persons purported to have sent it. Once messages have been authenticated, they are
recorded for transparency and historical proof of accountability.

For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to restore faith.
