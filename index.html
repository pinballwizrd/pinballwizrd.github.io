<h1>How to use GameStop NFT Wallet:</h1>

<br> <br>

Select the option to "Recover Wallet" and enter a 12 word private key to access a wallet you previously created or one you were given the private key to. Alternatively, "Create New Wallet" can be used to generate a brand new wallet/phrase.
<br> <br> <br>

    
Set a password to access your wallet on your computer. This can function 
as a backup to losing your 12 word private key so long as the account is not erased from your browser, or you lose/break your computer. If you do lose your 12 word
mnemonic, you should create a new wallet with a newly generated phrase immediately and send everything to its public address from the account you can't find the private key to.
<br> <br>
From the wallet you can transfer NFTs to other public addresses on Loopring L2 or to the Etherium L1 layer where bitcoin, etherium, USDC and other cryptographic 
currencies are offered on exchanges created by companies such as Binance or Coinbase. This means you can make an account at these organizations' websites to buy crypto
with dollars, or sell crypto for dollars. You need to pay a percentage of the money that you transfer as a fee depending on the supply and demand for 
the millions of transaction processors at the time, but you can simply send from GameStop wallet on layer 1 directly to a public address of your coinbase/binance account
in order to make an offer of crypto for dollars on their exchanges. From those websites, dollar proceeds from sold funds can be withdrawn to fiat currency bank accounts.
