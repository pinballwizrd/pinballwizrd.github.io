Select the option to "Recover Wallet" and enter a 12 word private key to access a wallet you previously created or one you were given the private key to. Alternatively, "Create New Wallet" can be used to generate a brand new wallet/phrase.
<br> <br> <br>

Set a password to access your wallet on your computer which can function as a backup to losing your 12 word private key so long as the account is not erased from your browser, 
or you lose/break your computer. If you lose your 12 word mnemonic after this step, you should create a new wallet with a newly generated phrase immediately and send 
your assets over to its public address from the account you can't find the private key to using the computer you loaded the lost private key into previously.
<br> <br>
From the wallet you can transfer NFTs to other public addresses, fiat currencies are offered on exchanges created by companies such as Binance or Coinbase. This means 
you can make an account at these organizations' websites to sell crypto for dollars. You can simply send from GameStop wallet on layer 1 directly to the public address o
of your coinbase/binance account. Dollar proceeds from sold funds can be withdrawn to fiat currency bank accounts.
