<h1>The Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>

<p>In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information across the network. <br>
  For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead <br> 
  its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to restore faith. </p>
