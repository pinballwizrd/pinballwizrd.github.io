<h1>The Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>
<p>Multiple generals have surrounded Byzantium with their armies and must attack simultaneously, but their means of communicating with one another about an attack 
  strategy, sending messages to one another using their messengers, could be imitated by the besieged Byzantines. Additionally, some generals have concerns that
  there are traitorous generals amoung them who will attempt to side with the Byzantines, and they'll purposely try to sabotage the timing of other generals' attacks
  with their messages. <br> <br>
  
  When incoming messengers arrive to claim it is some general's intention to attack at some time, recipient generals need a way to be certain whether messages they recieve 
  are brought from messengers of allies, or decoys sent by Byzantines or traitors. No stated time to strike can be trusted without some solution to this problem.
  <br> <br>
  
  Because just one general sending his army to attack at the incorrect time could drive the entire system to catastrophic failure, even one fault in a potential 
  solution that drives any loyal general to act with the belief that a false message is true for any amount of time, so that he may be fooled and convinced into
  attacking without all loyal generals having previously agreed on that time to attack, when certain that all other loyal generals would be so coordinated, Byzantium 
  will have the ability to defeat them in battle if they don't develop a full proof system to subvert all unreliable sources of information. 
 <br> <br> <br>
  
  
  The allegory was developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a 
  concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable. 
 <br> <br>
 
  This problem does not change when internet is brought into the equation. Tools for encrypted information transmissions across far distances instantaneously 
  can only complement the solution to their problem. Encryption is encrypted to be decrypted by people. Electrical signals transforming digital databases can be imitated
  and life and death are at stake for one single failure. The solution to Byzantine Generals is called a blockchain, and it could be done with participants in the system  
  using paper and pen.
  <br> <br>
  
  What remains to be transmitted is agreement.  Agreement relies on scarcity because there must be a finite amount of considered agreeors whose opinions must be 
  unanimous. Otherwise, no matter the number of stated opinions, no conclusion could be drawn about whether agreement has been reached for an idea relevant to any 
  considered contestants or stakeholders. Information itself implicitly is what it is, but the possibilty of making information itself scarce seemingly contradicts
  that by mathematical impossibility. If there is information in existence, then there absolutely has to be some way that it may be replicated with unlimited resources.
  The fact is that an enemy could discover it, by chance alone. Just like any expectation of any possibility to be true, it could turn out that a guess about how 
  agreement may be signaled on blockchain by a person unaware of the signal required to do so might be correct, and that guess would enable the guessor to wield the 
  the same amount of consideration in that definition of agreement for their own purposes as was alotted for that signal to represent by the actor in the system who 
  previously held control over the scarce information required to prove agreement for users of the blockchain which the signal was guessed on. The signature that must
  be guessed satisfies a mathematical proof that the person who owns the bitcoin funds knows the private key and is authorized for a transaction to happen. A private 
  key for bitcoin is a 256-bit number. This means that it is represented in binary in 256 numbers of 0 or 1. In total, this means there are a total of (almost) 2^256 
  combinations of private keys: About 10 million million million million million million million million. 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494336.
  More private keys are possible than there are atoms estimated in the univers. The security of bitcoin relies on no two same private addresses being generated ever.
  
  <br> <br>
  
  A transaction of information on blockchain is unlike any other transfer of information before its invention. Any action in the physical world could theoretically be
  reversed by further actions to remove its effects from existence permanently. When action is taken by self-interested agents, they can be expected to undertake great
  efforts to advance themselves no matter the cost to interests of other individuals affected by them. It has not previously been possible to tie an agreement to its
  own consequence. Now when any freely acting individual wishes to say what they think, it is impossible to deprive them of the ability to tie their word to their 
  reputation, either by imitiation, dilution, or censorship by bandits running a central, corruptible, and expectedly self-interested, system.
  <br> <br>
  
  A centralized system may be possible for the generals to adopt using mutually known and trusted messengers to handle all of their communications, but the allegory 
  calls for any messenger to be potentially imitated by besieged Byzantines or even traitors. Not all loyal generals will know and have trusted messengers shared by others.
  Messangers could be given a unique badge predetermined by loyal generals that is temporarily secret (until discovered by the enemy), but that would require proving 
  who will act with loyalty and who will betray them at Byzantium beforehand. Regardless, it would need to be replaced completely whenever knowingly fallen into
  enemy hands, and that may very well be never if the enemy recognizes the importance of this identifying mark to their survival. Incentives are surely made for the
  now empowered messangers with authority to decide life or death for countless people.
  <br> <br>
  
  Countermeasures must be taken to avoid deception from enemies. Any faults cannot be reliably reversed in aftersight to restore broken faith in the network, as a 
  single fraudulent message believed means potentially instant failure in the case where a loyal general believes and acts upon a message from a decoy which falsely 
  declares the time to strike is immediately. <br><br>
  <br>
  
  To understand what "blockchain" refers to and why its the essential base algorithm in order to create scarce information, it is helpful to understand the applications
  of the solution. Picture how it may be valuable to be able to make information scarce. Clearly in this problem, it would be useful for generals to have the means
  to make the information of what time they each claim they should attack scarce, so that agreement can be viewed by all of the loyal generals before they go to battle.
  


  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  The problem of money: People want to trade and do not trust one another implicitly to exchange information and goods honestly. They need something scarce and yet
  "fungible" meaning like gold it can be melted down to the same commonly valued commodity, people don't want to trade their wealth for all perishable or 
  otherwise not yet needed goods at once when they exchange value and money might solve this but it must be durable so that it stands the test of time, 
  "it" must be easily transferrable (gold is heavy as Hell and paper was used representing its ownership) now fiat currency is transported be electrical
  signal representing numbers held in computer databases of banks and financial institutions, and finally satisfaction of all these requirements allows an
  idea to take on monetary value so that the most effective solution to humans' problem of what to use as money expectedly outperforms all others in growth
  of monetary premium exponentially. <br> <br>
  
  The problem of money will never be solved with centralized fiat currency.  
  <br> <br>
  
  
   In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information 
  across the network. For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction 
  histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to intervene in order to restore faith. <br>
 <br>
  Getting your data is life or death for those people you're up against and encryption is made to be unencrypted by people. How do you ensure that no 
  decoy messenger could ever mislead generals in the field into believing messages sent from Byzantines are from other generals besieging Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  How do you record no Byzantine faults?  What is the solution so that no single, corruptible, centralized, and potentially wrongdoing authority must be entrusted with control?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing solution to Byzantine generals relies on the ability of all generals to provide unique and unforgeable signatures which must be forgeable and known, 
  without comprimising the unforgable nature of each general's unique signature. The general's signature needs to be undiscovered by participants, yet they need to
  percieve it as valuable for reaching agreement. This can be made possible by each general signing a seperate signature, which they never reveal to anybody else, 
  which is required for a second signature to be created, which may not be used to find an general's first, private, signature, and proves their signature was given.
