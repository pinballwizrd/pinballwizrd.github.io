    <h1>Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Allegory developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.<br>
      <p>Multiple generals besiege Byzantium. They've encircled the city, but they must decide when to assault as a group. They will win if all generals assault simultaneously; however, they will lose if they attack without coordination.<br>
      <p>In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information across the network.<br>
