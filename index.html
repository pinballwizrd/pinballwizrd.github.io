<h1>The Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>
<p>Multiple generals have surrounded Byzantium with their armies and must attack simultaneously, but their means of communicating with one another about an attack 
  strategy, sending messages to one another using their messengers, could be imitated by the besieged Byzantines. Additionally, some generals have concerns that
  there are traitorous generals amoung them who will attempt to side with the Byzantines, and they'll purposely try to sabotage the timing of other generals' attacks
  with their messages. <br> <br>
  
  When incoming messengers arrive to claim it is some general's intention to attack at some time, recipient generals need a way to be certain whether messages they recieve 
  are brought from messengers of allies, or decoys sent by Byzantines or traitors. No stated time to strike can be trusted without some solution to this problem.
  <br> <br>
  
  Because just one general sending his army to attack at the incorrect time could drive the entire system to catastrophic failure, even one fault in a potential 
  solution that drives any loyal general to act with the belief that a false message is true for any amount of time, so that he may be fooled and convinced into
  attacking without all loyal generals having previously agreed on that time to attack when certain that all other loyal generals would be so coordinated, Byzantium 
  will defeat them in battle without development of a full proof system to subvert unreliable sources of information. 
 <br> <br> <br>
  
  
  The allegory was developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a 
  concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable. 
 <br> <br>
 
  A centralized system may be possible for the generals to adopt using known and mutually trusted messengers to handle all of their communications, but 
  the allegory specifically calls for messengers to be able to be imitated by besieged Byzantines. Also, any faults cannot be reliably reversed in afterthought 
  to restore broken faith in the network. A single fraudulent message believed means potentially instant failure if a general believes and acts upon a message
  from a decoy which falsely declares the time to strike is immediately. This problem does not change when internet is brought into the equation. Encrypted database 
  transmission across far distances instantaneously is only a complement to the solution to their problem. <br> <br>
  
  The problem of money: People want to trade and do not trust one another implicitly to exchange information and goods honestly. They need something scarce and yet
  "fungible" meaning like gold it can be melted down to the same commonly valued commodity, people don't want to trade their wealth for all perishable or 
  otherwise not yet needed goods at once when they exchange value and money might solve this but it must be durable so that it stands the test of time, 
  "it" must be easily transferrable (gold is heavy as Hell and paper was used representing its ownership) now fiat currency is transported be electrical
  signal representing numbers held in computer databases of banks and financial institutions, and finally satisfaction of all these requirements allows an
  idea to take on monetary value so that the most effective solution to humans' problem of what to use as money expectedly outperforms all others in growth
  of monetary premium exponentially. <br> <br>
  
  The problem of money will never be solved with centralized fiat currency. It could be done with participants in the system  
  using only paper and pen, and the solution to Byzantine Generals is called a blockchain. 
  <br> <br>
  
   In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information 
  across the network. For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction 
  histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to intervene in order to restore faith. <br>
 <br>
  Getting your data is life or death for those people you're up against and encryption is made to be unencrypted by people. How do you ensure that no 
  decoy messenger could ever mislead generals in the field into believing messages sent from Byzantines are from other generals besieging Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  How do you record no Byzantine faults?  What is the solution so that no single, corruptible, centralized, and potentially wrongdoing authority must be entrusted with control?<br>
