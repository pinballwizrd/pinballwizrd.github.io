<h1>The Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>
<p>Multiple generals have surrounded Byzantium with their armies and must attack simultaneously, but their means of communicating with one another about an attack 
  strategy, sending messages to one another using their messengers, could be imitated by the besieged Byzantines. Additionally, some generals have concerns that
  there are traitorous generals amoung them who will attempt to side with the Byzantines, and they'll purposely try to sabotage the timing of other generals' attacks
  with their messages. <br> <br>
  
  When incoming messengers arrive to claim it is some general's intention to attack at some time, recipient generals need a way to be certain whether messages they recieve 
  are brought from messengers of allies, or decoys sent by Byzantines or traitors. No stated time to strike can be trusted without some solution to this problem.
  <br> <br>
  
  Because just one general sending his army to attack at the incorrect time could drive the entire system to catastrophic failure, even one fault in a potential 
  solution that drives any loyal general to act with the belief that a false message is true for any amount of time, so that he may be fooled and convinced into
  attacking without all loyal generals having previously agreed on that time to attack, when certain that all other loyal generals would be so coordinated, Byzantium 
  will have the ability to defeat them in battle if they don't develop a full proof system to subvert all unreliable sources of information. 
 <br> <br> <br>
  
  
  The allegory was developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a 
  concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable. 
 <br> <br>
 
  This problem does not change when internet is brought into the equation. Tools for encrypted information transmissions across far distances instantaneously 
  can only complement the solution to their problem. Encryption is encrypted to be decrypted by people. Electrical signals transforming digital databases can be imitated
  and life and death are at stake for one single failure. The solution to Byzantine Generals is called a blockchain, and it could be done with participants in the system  
  using paper and pen.
  <br> <br>
  
  What remains to be transmitted is agreement. Information itself implicitly is what it is, but the possibilty of making information itself scarce seemingly contradicts
  that by mathematical impossibility. If there is information in existence, then there absolutely has to be some way that it can be replicated once discovered. The fact
  is that an enemy could discover it, by chance alone. Just like any expectation of any possibility to be true, it could turn out that a guess about how agreement may 
  be signaled on blockchain by a person unaware of the signal required to do so might be correct, and that guess would enable the guessor to wield the amount of 
  consideration in the definition of agreement for their own purposes that was decided for that signal by an actor in the system who holds it until the information
  reaches someone who takes advantage of it.
  
  A centralized system may be possible for the generals to adopt using mutually known and trusted messengers to handle all of their communications, but the allegory 
  calls for any messenger to be potentially imitated by besieged Byzantines. Countermeasures must be taken to avoid deception from enemies. Any faults cannot be 
  reliably reversed to restore broken faith in the network in afterthought, as a single fraudulent message believed means potentially instant failure in the case a 
  loyal general believes and acts upon a message from a decoy which falsely declares the time to strike is immediately. <br><br>
  <br>
  
  
  Agreement relies on scarcity because there must be a finite amount of considered agreeors whose opinions must be unanimous. Otherwise, no matter the number of stated
  opinions, no conclusion could be drawn about whether agreement has been reached for an idea relevant to contestants of 
  
  
  The signature will be a mathematical proof that the person who owns the bitcoin funds knows the private key and is authorized for a transaction to happen
  
  
  
  
  
  The problem of money: People want to trade and do not trust one another implicitly to exchange information and goods honestly. They need something scarce and yet
  "fungible" meaning like gold it can be melted down to the same commonly valued commodity, people don't want to trade their wealth for all perishable or 
  otherwise not yet needed goods at once when they exchange value and money might solve this but it must be durable so that it stands the test of time, 
  "it" must be easily transferrable (gold is heavy as Hell and paper was used representing its ownership) now fiat currency is transported be electrical
  signal representing numbers held in computer databases of banks and financial institutions, and finally satisfaction of all these requirements allows an
  idea to take on monetary value so that the most effective solution to humans' problem of what to use as money expectedly outperforms all others in growth
  of monetary premium exponentially. <br> <br>
  
  The problem of money will never be solved with centralized fiat currency.  
  <br> <br>
  
   In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information 
  across the network. For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction 
  histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to intervene in order to restore faith. <br>
 <br>
  Getting your data is life or death for those people you're up against and encryption is made to be unencrypted by people. How do you ensure that no 
  decoy messenger could ever mislead generals in the field into believing messages sent from Byzantines are from other generals besieging Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  How do you record no Byzantine faults?  What is the solution so that no single, corruptible, centralized, and potentially wrongdoing authority must be entrusted with control?<br>
