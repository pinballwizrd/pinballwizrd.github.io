<h1>The Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>
<p>In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information across the network. For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted <br> 
  to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to intervene in order to restore faith that their monetary system works.

  <p>The problem of money isn't solved. </p>
