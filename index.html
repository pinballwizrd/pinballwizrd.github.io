<h1>The Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>
<p>Two generals must attack Byzantium simultaneously, but have no means of communicating with one another about an attack strategy without sending <br>
  messengers who could be imitated by the besieged Byzantines. When a messenger arrives claiming it is one General's intention to attack at some time, <br>
  the recipient general couldn't know for certain whether they've been given a message from an authentic or decoy messenger. <br>
 <br>
  The allegory was developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a <br>
  concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable. So what strategy should the generals follow in order to successfully occupy Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information <br>
  across the network. For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction <br>
  histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to intervene in order to restore faith. <br>
 <br>
  A centralized system may be possible for the generals to adopt using known and mutually trusted messengers to handle all of their communications, but <br>
  the allegory specifically calls for messengers to be able to be imitated by besieged Byzantines. You must not know if a messenger is ally or foe. Also, <br>
  faults cannot be reversed in afterthought as with central monetary systems. A single fraudulent message believed means potentially instant failure. <br>
  This problem does not change when internet is brought into the equation. Encrypted database transmission across far distances instantaneously is only a <br>
  complement to the solution to their problem. The problem of money will never be solved with centralized fiat currency. It could be done with participants <br>
  using only paper and pen, and the solution to Byzantine Generals is called a blockchain. <br>
 <br>
  Getting your data is life or death for those people you're up against and encryption is made to be unencrypted by people. How do you ensure that no <br>
  decoy messenger could ever mislead generals in the field into believing messages sent from Byzantines are from other generals besieging Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  How do you record no Byzantine faults?  What is the solution so that no single, corruptible, centralized, and potentially wrongdoing authority must be entrusted with control?<br>
  <br>
  The problem of money: People want to trade and do not trust one another implicitly to exchange information and goods. They need something scarce and yet<br>
"fungible" meaning like gold it can be melted down to the same commonly valued commodity, people don't want to trade their wealth for all perishable or <br>
otherwise not yet needed goods at once when they exchange value and money might solve this but it must be durable so that it stands the test of time, <br>
"it" must be easily transferrable (gold is heavy as Hell and paper was used representing its ownership) now fiat currency is transported be electrical<br>
signal representing numbers held in computer databases of banks and financial institutions, and finally satisfaction of all these requirements allows an<br>
idea to take on monetary value so that the most effective solution to humans' problem of what to use as money expectedly outperforms all others in growth<br>
of monetary premium exponentially.<br>
