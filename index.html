<h1>The Byzantine Generals Problem</h1>
<p>In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information across the network. For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted <br> 
  Two generals must attack Byzantium simultaneously, but have no means of communicating with one another about an attack strategy without sending <br>
  messengers who could be imitated by the besieged Byzantines. When a messenger arrives claiming it is one General's intention to attack at some time, <br>
  the recipient general couldn't know for certain whether they've been given a message from an authentic or decoy messenger. <br>
 <br>
  The allegory was developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a <br>
  concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable. So what strategy should the generals follow in order to successfully occupy Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  In centralized systems, an authority is trusted to disseminate accurate information while preventing the spread of erroneous or fraudulent information <br>
  across the network. For example, in the traditional financial system, banks are trusted to provide clients with accurate balances and transaction <br>
  histories. If a bank tries to deceive or mislead its consumers, the central bank or government is authorized to intervene in order to restore faith. <br>
 <br>
  A centralized system may be possible for the generals to adopt using known and mutually trusted messengers to handle all of their communications, but <br>
  the allegory specifically calls for messengers to be able to be imitated by besieged Byzantines. You must not know if a messenger is ally or foe. Also, <br>
  faults cannot be reversed in afterthought as with central monetary systems. A single fraudulent message believed means potentially instant failure. <br>
  This problem does not change when internet is brought into the equation. Encrypted database transmission across far distances instantaneously is only a <br>
  complement to the solution to their problem. The problem of money will never be solved with centralized fiat currency. It could be done with participants <br>
  using only paper and pen, and the solution to Byzantine Generals is called a blockchain. <br>
 <br>
  Getting your data is life or death for those people you're up against and encryption is made to be unencrypted by people. How do you ensure that no <br>
  decoy messenger could ever mislead generals in the field into believing messages sent from Byzantines are from other generals besieging Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  How do you record no Byzantine faults?  <br>
